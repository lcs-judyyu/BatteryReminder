// Purpose: These two functions combined allow local notifications to be scheduled by the application.

/// Invoke this function once prior to the first time a notification needs to be published.
/// The user is prompted to allow this app to send them notifications.
func askNotificationPermission() {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { success, error in
        if success {
            Logger().notice("Permission to receive notifications has been granted by the user.")
        } else if let error = error {
            Logger().notice("\(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}

/// Publish a local notification that runs after a specified wait time in seconds; creates a non-repeating notification.
/// Example arguments are for an application that allows a student to request campus leave and report back in when on campus again. See [this article for full details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/scheduling_a_notification_locally_from_your_app) and [this article for how to handle notifications delivered while your app is running in the foreground](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/handling_notifications_and_notification-related_actions).
/// - Parameters:
///   - title: The title of the notification; should be kept brief. e.g.: "Return to Campus Suggested"
///   - subtitle: The subtitle of the notification; should be kept brief. e.g.: "40 minutes of leave time remain"
///   - body: The body of the notification; can be somewhat longer. "Walking time from Foodland to campus is about 32 minutes."
///   - timeUntil: A length of time, measured in seconds, until the notification will be published.
///   - identifier: A unique identifier for notifications published by this app, e.g.: "com.mydomainname.localnotificationsexample"
